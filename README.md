# Badges and Schedules

## Objectives

1. Define methods that use iteration and control the return values of those methods.
2. Define methods that call other methods.

## Instructions

In this lab you'll be learning how to iterate through an array and output the
results in different ways. Write your code in the `conference_badges.rb` file
and you can run the test suite using the `learn test` command.

### Create a `badge_maker` method

You're hosting a conference and need to print badges for the speakers. Each
badge should read: `"Hello, my name is _____."` Write a `badge_maker` method that,
when provided a person's name, will create and return this message. E.g.:

```bash
badge_maker("Arel")
=> "Hello, my name is Arel."
```

### Create a `batch_badge_creator` method

Once the list of speakers for your conference has been finalized you'll want to
get the badges printed for all of your speakers.

* Write a `batch_badge_creator` method that takes an array of names as an
  argument and returns an array of badge messages.

### Create an `assign_rooms` method

You just realized that you also need to give each speaker a room assignment.
Write a method called `assign_rooms` that takes the list of speakers and assigns
each speaker to a room. Make sure that each room only has one speaker.

* You have rooms 1-7.

* return a list of room assignments in the form of: "Hello, \_\_\_\_\_! You'll
  be assigned to room \_\_\_\_\_!"

* *Hint*: Think about how you will assign a room number to each person. Array
  items are indexed, meaning that you can access each element by its index
  number. When you are iterating through an array, you can keep track of the
  index number of the current iteration using an enumerator method called
  [`each_with_index`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_index) or a closely related method called [`.with_index`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20258086/difference-between-each-with-index-and-each-with-index-in-ruby).
  
* *Hint*: Remember that the return value of the `each` (or `each_with_index`)
  method is the original array that you are calling it on. What we need to do
  here is iterate through the array containing the list of speakers, create the
  room assignment strings for each speaker, and return a _new_ array containing
  the messages. There is an enumerator method that does just that. Google or use
  [Ruby Docs](http://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Enumerable.html) to find the
  correct method.

### Create a `printer` method

Now you have to tell the printer what to print. Create a method called `printer`
that will output first the results of the `batch_badge_creator` method and then
of the `assign_rooms` method to the screen.

* *Hint*: Remember that methods can call other methods. If the return value of
  `assign_rooms` is an array of room assignments, how can you print out each
  assignment? You'll need to iterate over your array of room assignments in
  order to `puts` out each individual assignment.
